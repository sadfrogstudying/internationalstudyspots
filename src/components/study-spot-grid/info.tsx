        Education should be as broad as man . . . If he is jovial, if he is
        mercurial, if he is a great-hearted, a cunning artificer, a strong
        commander, a potent ally, ingenious, useful, elegant, witty, prophet,
        diviner - society has need of all these. The imagination must be
        addressed. <br /> - <i>Ralph Waldo Emerson</i> 🦧🍎
